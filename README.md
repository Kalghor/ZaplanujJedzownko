Scrum Lab Workshop
The aim of the project was to teach us to work in a group and simulate one scrum sprint. One of the tools I got to know better while working on this project is trello, git and github
Team project to manage meals, meal plans. We have implemented Dao classes in the application to communicate with the database. The database stores users, admin and the logged in user's plans. Views were coded with html and jstl. The business logiga has been implemented in Java.

## Description of the action
Only logged in users and admin have access to the application.
The logged in user has the opportunity to use the basic possibilities offered by CRUD, in particular:
- adding a recipe,
- adding a recipe to the plan,
- removing a recipe from the plan,
- removing a recipe from the list of recipes,
- editing an existing recipe,
- displaying a specific recipe and its details.
Moreover, after logging in, the application displays the number of added recipes, the number of added recipes and the details of the recently added plan.
